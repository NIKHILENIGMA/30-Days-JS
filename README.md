# 30-Day JavaScript Challenge

Welcome to the 30-Day JavaScript Challenge! This challenge is designed to help you improve your JavaScript skills by completing a task or building a feature every day.

## Structure

- Each day's challenge will be posted in a separate folder named after the day (e.g., `Day-01`, `Day-02`, etc.).

I will push the solution for each day's challenge to this GitHub repository. Stay tuned for daily updates!
